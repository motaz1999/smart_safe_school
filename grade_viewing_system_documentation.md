# Grade Viewing System Documentation

## Overview

The Grade Viewing System provides a comprehensive solution for viewing and managing grades across different user types (students and admins) with proper organization by semester and grade number. The system implements a unified architecture that separates grades by semester and grade number (1 or 2) for clear academic tracking.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GradeService** (`lib/services/grade_service.dart`)
   - Unified service for all grade operations
   - Handles data retrieval and organization
   - Provides filtering and statistics capabilities

2. **Student Grade Screen** (`lib/screens/student/grades_screen.dart`)
   - Real-time grade viewing for students
   - Organized by semester with tabbed interface
   - Shows Grade 1 and Grade 2 separately for each subject

3. **Admin Grade Reports** (`lib/screens/admin/admin_grade_reports.dart`)
   - Comprehensive grade reporting for administrators
   - Advanced filtering by class, subject, semester, and grade number
   - Statistical analysis and grade distribution

## Data Structures

### OrganizedStudentGrades
```dart
class OrganizedStudentGrades {
  final String studentName;
  final String studentId;
  final String? classId;
  final Map<String, SemesterGrades> semestersBySemesterId;
  final List<AcademicYear> academicYears;
  final List<Semester> semesters;
}
```

### OrganizedSchoolGrades
```dart
class OrganizedSchoolGrades {
  final Map<String, ClassGrades> classesByClassId;
  final List<SchoolClass> classes;
  final List<Subject> subjects;
  final List<AcademicYear> academicYears;
  final List<Semester> semesters;
}
```

### Hierarchical Organization
- **Class** → **Semester** → **Subject** → **Grade Number (1 or 2)** → **Individual Grades**

## Features

### Student Grade View

#### Key Features:
- **Semester-based Navigation**: Tabbed interface for different semesters
- **Grade Separation**: Clear distinction between Grade 1 and Grade 2
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Color-coded grade performance
- **Subject Overview**: Average calculations and grade comparisons
- **Real-time Data**: Direct database integration with refresh capability

#### UI Components:
- Header with student welcome message
- Semester tabs for navigation
- Semester overview with statistics
- Subject cards showing both grade numbers
- Grade comparison between Grade 1 and Grade 2

### Admin Grade Reports

#### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Filter by class, subject, semester, and grade number
- **Hierarchical Display**: Organized by Class → Semester → Subject → Grades
- **Statistical Analysis**: Grade distribution, averages, and performance metrics
- **Expandable Sections**: Drill-down capability for detailed views
- **Real-time Statistics**: Dynamic calculation based on filters

#### Filter Options:
- **Class Filter**: View grades for specific classes
- **Subject Filter**: Focus on particular subjects
- **Semester Filter**: Analyze specific academic periods
- **Grade Number Filter**: Separate Grade 1 and Grade 2 analysis

#### Statistics Provided:
- Total number of grades
- Average grade across filtered data
- Highest and lowest grades
- Grade distribution (A, B, C, D, F)
- Performance analytics

## Database Integration

### Query Optimization
The system uses optimized database queries with proper joins to minimize database calls:

```sql
-- Student grades query
SELECT g.*, 
       s.name as subject_name, s.code as subject_code,
       sem.name as semester_name, sem.semester_number,
       ay.name as academic_year_name
FROM grades g
JOIN subjects s ON g.subject_id = s.id
JOIN semesters sem ON g.semester_id = sem.id
JOIN academic_years ay ON sem.academic_year_id = ay.id
WHERE g.student_id = ? 
ORDER BY ay.start_date DESC, sem.semester_number, s.name, g.grade_number;
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Joins**: Single query retrieval with related data
- **Proper Indexing**: Optimized for grade queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Academic years and semesters cached
- **Lazy Loading**: Grade details loaded on demand

## API Methods

### GradeService Methods

#### Student Methods
```dart
Future<OrganizedStudentGrades> getStudentGrades(String studentId)
```
- Retrieves all grades for a specific student
- Organizes by semester and subject
- Includes academic context data

#### Admin Methods
```dart
Future<OrganizedSchoolGrades> getSchoolGrades({
  String? classId,
  String? subjectId,
  String? semesterId,
  int? gradeNumber,
})
```
- Retrieves school-wide grades with filtering
- Supports multiple filter combinations
- Returns organized hierarchical data

```dart
Future<GradeStatistics> getGradeStatistics({
  String? classId,
  String? subjectId,
  String? semesterId,
  int? gradeNumber,
})
```
- Calculates statistical metrics
- Supports same filtering options
- Returns comprehensive analytics

#### Utility Methods
```dart
Future<List<AcademicYear>> getAcademicYears(int schoolId)
Future<List<Semester>> getAllSemesters(int schoolId)
Future<List<Subject>> getSubjects(int schoolId)
Future<List<SchoolClass>> getClasses(int schoolId)
```

## Grade Color Coding

The system uses consistent color coding across all interfaces:

```dart
Color _getGradeColor(double grade) {
  if (grade >= 18) return Colors.green;        // Excellent (A)
  else if (grade >= 16) return Colors.lightGreen;  // Good (B)
  else if (grade >= 14) return Colors.orange;      // Average (C)
  else if (grade >= 12) return Colors.deepOrange;  // Below Average (D)
  else return Colors.red;                          // Poor (F)
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Access Control
- **Student Access**: Students can only view their own grades
- **Admin Access**: Admins can view all grades within their school
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid authentication

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted Transmission**: All data transmitted securely
- **Audit Logging**: Grade access tracked for compliance
- **Privacy Compliance**: Student data protected according to regulations

## Error Handling

### Exception Management
```dart
class GradeException implements Exception {
  final String message;
  GradeException(this.message);
}
```

### Error Scenarios Handled:
- Network connectivity issues
- Database query failures
- Authentication failures
- Missing or invalid data
- Permission denied scenarios

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration
- **TeacherService**: Reuses grade management methods
- **AdminService**: Extended with grade reporting capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Student Grade Access
```dart
// In student dashboard
final gradeService = GradeService();
final studentGrades = await gradeService.getStudentGrades(studentId);

// Display organized by semester
for (final semesterEntry in studentGrades.semestersBySemesterId.entries) {
  final semester = semesterEntry.value.semester;
  final subjects = semesterEntry.value.subjectsBySubjectId;
  // Render semester tab with subjects
}
```

### Admin Grade Filtering
```dart
// Filter grades by class and semester
final filteredGrades = await gradeService.getSchoolGrades(
  classId: selectedClassId,
  semesterId: selectedSemesterId,
);

// Get statistics for filtered data
final statistics = await gradeService.getGradeStatistics(
  classId: selectedClassId,
  semesterId: selectedSemesterId,
);

- **Solution**: Adjust filter parameters or check data availability

#### Performance Issues
- **Cause**: Large dataset without pagination
- **Solution**: Implement pagination for large schools

#### Authentication Errors
- **Cause**: Session expired or invalid permissions
- **Solution**: Re-authenticate or check user permissions

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Database Cleanup**: Remove old academic year data
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Query performance analysis
3. **Security Updates**: Regular security patches
4. **Backup Verification**: Grade data backup validation

### Monitoring Metrics
