# Document Feature Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The students were not appearing in the "Select Students" section when teachers tried to send documents. After investigation, two issues were found:
1. The `get_users_by_type` RPC function in the database was not returning the `class_id` field, which is needed to filter students by their class.
2. There was an infinite recursion issue in the database policies for the documents table causing the "Failed to send document" error.

## Root Cause
1. The `get_users_by_type` RPC function in the database was not returning the `class_id` field, which is needed to filter students by their class. The teacher service was trying to filter students by `class_id`, but this field was not available in the response.

2. The document management SQL commands were creating policies that conflicted with the existing policies in the complete database setup, causing infinite recursion in policy evaluation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Database Function
Created `update_get_users_by_type_with_class_id_corrected.sql` which properly handles the function update by first dropping the existing function and then creating a new one with the `class_id` field:

```sql
-- Drop the existing function first
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_users_by_type(integer, text, integer, integer);

-- Create the updated function with class_id field
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_users_by_type(
    p_school_id INTEGER,
    p_user_type TEXT,
    p_limit INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,
    p_offset INTEGER DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS TABLE(
    id UUID,
    name TEXT,
    user_id TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    class_id UUID,  -- Added class_id field
    class_name TEXT,
    gender TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
)
```

### 2. Fixed Database Policy Issues
Created `document_management_sql_commands_integrated.sql` which resolves the infinite recursion issue by properly integrating with the existing database policies and avoiding conflicts:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies before creating new ones to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can upload documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can upload documents" ON storage.objects;
-- ... (similar for other policies)

-- Added conditional RLS enabling to prevent conflicts
DO $$ 
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_policy WHERE polrelid = 'documents'::regclass) THEN
    ALTER TABLE documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  END IF;
END $$;
```

### 3. Updated Teacher Service
Modified the `getStudentsInClass` method in `lib/services/teacher_service.dart` to properly filter students by class:

```dart
// Get all students in the school using the RPC function
final response = await _supabase.rpc('get_users_by_type', params: {
  'p_school_id': schoolId,
  'p_user_type': 'student',
});

// Filter students by classId
final studentsInClass = (response as List)
    .where((json) => json['class_id'] == classId)
    .map((json) => UserProfile.fromJson(json))
    .toList();
```

### 4. Added Error Handling
Added error handling in the UI to show a message when no students are found in a class:

```dart
// Check if students list is empty
if (students.isEmpty) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    const SnackBar(content: Text('No students found in this class')),
  );
  return;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Execute the SQL script `update_get_users_by_type_with_class_id_corrected.sql` in your Supabase database to update the `get_users_by_type` function.

2. Execute the SQL script `document_management_sql_commands_integrated.sql` in your Supabase database to fix the policy conflicts.

3. The teacher service and UI changes are already implemented in the code.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, teachers should be able to:
1. Click on "Send Document" for a class
2. See the list of students in that class in the "Select Students" section
3. Select/deselect students as needed
4. Successfully send documents to the selected students

## Files Modified
1. `lib/services/teacher_service.dart` - Updated getStudentsInClass method
2. `lib/screens/teacher/classes_screen.dart` - Added error handling for empty student list
3. `update_get_users_by_type_with_class_id_corrected.sql` - Database function update script
4. `document_management_sql_commands_integrated.sql` - Database policy fix script

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Log in as a teacher
2. Navigate to "My Classes"
3. Select a class and click "Send Document"
4. Verify that students appear in the "Select Students" list
5. Select some students and send a document
6. Log in as a student and verify they can see and download the document
