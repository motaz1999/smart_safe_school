# Academic Year and Semester Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing plan for the academic year and semester implementation with the specific dates requested:
- First semester: 15/09 to 31/12
- Second semester: 01/01 to 31/03
- Third semester: 01/04 to 10/06

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Database Function Testing

#### A. Test create_academic_year Function
1. **Test Case**: Create academic year with specific semester dates
   - **Precondition**: Database with existing school
   - **Action**: Call `create_academic_year` function with a school ID and date range
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - Academic year is created with correct start and end dates
     - First semester is created from 15/09 to 31/12
     - Second semester is created from 01/01 to 31/03
     - Third semester is created from 01/04 to 10/06
     - First semester is marked as current

2. **Test Case**: Verify semester names
   - **Precondition**: Academic year with semesters created
   - **Action**: Query semesters table
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - First semester name is "First Semester"
     - Second semester name is "Second Semester"
     - Third semester name is "Third Semester"

#### B. Test create_school_with_academic_year Function
1. **Test Case**: Create school with academic year and semesters
   - **Precondition**: Clean database state
   - **Action**: Call `create_school_with_academic_year` function with school details
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - School is created with provided details
     - Academic year is created with current year name (e.g., "2025-2026")
     - Academic year has correct start date (15/09 of current year) and end date (10/06 of next year)
     - Three semesters are created with correct dates
     - First semester is marked as current

### 2. Flutter App Testing

#### A. Academic Year Management Screen
1. **Test Case**: Display academic years
   - **Precondition**: School with academic years exists
   - **Action**: Navigate to academic year management screen
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - List of academic years is displayed
     - Each academic year shows correct start and end dates
     - Current academic year is highlighted

2. **Test Case**: Create new academic year
   - **Precondition**: On academic year management screen
   - **Action**: Click "Create Academic Year" button and fill form with specific dates
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - New academic year is created
     - Three semesters are automatically created with correct dates
     - First semester is marked as current
     - UI is updated to show the new academic year

#### B. Semester Display
1. **Test Case**: Display semesters for academic year
   - **Precondition**: Academic year with semesters exists
   - **Action**: Navigate to semester view for an academic year
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - All three semesters are displayed
     - Each semester shows correct start and end dates
     - Semester names are displayed correctly
     - Current semester is highlighted

### 3. Integration Testing

#### A. Academic Year and Semester Usage in Other Features
1. **Test Case**: Use semesters in grade recording
   - **Precondition**: Academic year with semesters exists
   - **Action**: Record grades for students in different semesters
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - Grades can be recorded for each semester
     - Semester information is correctly associated with grades

2. **Test Case**: Use semesters in attendance tracking
   - **Precondition**: Academic year with semesters exists
   - **Action**: Record attendance for students in different semesters
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - Attendance can be recorded with semester information
     - Reports can be generated by semester

### 4. Edge Case Testing

#### A. Date Boundary Testing
1. **Test Case**: Semester start and end dates are exact
   - **Precondition**: Academic year with semesters created
   - **Action**: Query semester dates
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - First semester starts on 15/09 and ends on 31/12
     - Second semester starts on 01/01 and ends on 31/03
     - Third semester starts on 01/04 and ends on 10/06

#### B. Multiple Academic Years
1. **Test Case**: Create multiple academic years
   - **Precondition**: School exists
   - **Action**: Create multiple academic years
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - Only one academic year is marked as current
     - All academic years have correct semester structures
     - No conflicts between academic years

## Test Data

### Sample Test Data
1. School: "Test School"
2. Academic Year Name: "2025-2026"
3. Academic Year Start Date: 15/09/2025
4. Academic Year End Date: 10/06/2026
5. First Semester: 15/09/2025 - 31/12/2025
6. Second Semester: 01/01/2026 - 31/03/2026
7. Third Semester: 01/04/2026 - 10/06/2026

## Testing Tools
1. Database query tools for direct verification
2. Flutter widget testing for UI components
3. Integration testing for end-to-end scenarios
4. Manual testing for user experience validation

## Success Criteria
