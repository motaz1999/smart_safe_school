## Grade Organization Structure

### Data Hierarchy
```
Map<String, Map<String, Map<int, List<Grade>>>>
├── Semester ID
    ├── Subject ID
        ├── Grade Number (1, 2, etc.)
            └── List<Grade> (individual student grades)
```

### Display Hierarchy
```
📚 Semester (e.g., "Fall 2024")
├── 📖 Subject (e.g., "Mathematics (MATH101)")
    ├── 📝 Grade 1 (e.g., "Grade 1 • 25 students • Average: 15.2/20")
    │   ├── 👤 Student A: 18.5/20
    │   ├── 👤 Student B: 16.0/20
    │   └── 👤 Student C: 14.5/20
    └── 📝 Grade 2 (e.g., "Grade 2 • 25 students • Average: 16.1/20")
        ├── 👤 Student A: 19.0/20
        └── ...
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Grade Color Coding

- **Orange (12-14)**: Average performance
- **Deep Orange (10-12)**: Below average
- **Red (0-10)**: Poor performance

### Statistics Provided
1. **Total Grades**: Count of all grades entered
2. **Unique Semesters**: Number of different semesters
3. **Unique Subjects**: Number of different subjects taught
4. **Average Grade**: Overall average across all grades
5. **Grade Distribution**: Percentage breakdown by performance level

### Search and Filter
- **Semester Search**: Filter semesters by name
- **Expandable Navigation**: Drill down through semester → subject → grade number
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant search results

## User Experience Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Expansion Tiles**: Clear hierarchy navigation
- **Color-coded Grades**: Instant performance recognition

- **Statistics Cards**: Key metrics at a glance

### Interactive Elements
- **Expandable Cards**: Tap to expand/collapse sections
- **Search Bar**: Real-time semester filtering
- **Refresh Functionality**: Pull-to-refresh and refresh button
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between grades and statistics

### Error Handling
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators during data fetch
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error display
- **Retry Functionality**: Easy error recovery
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data exists

## Database Integration

### Query Optimization
- **Single Query**: Fetches all grades with related data in one call
- **Join Operations**: Includes student, subject, and semester information
- **Efficient Organization**: Client-side organization for optimal performance

### Data Relationships
```sql
grades
├── student (profiles table)
├── subject (subjects table)
├── semester (semesters table)
└── academic_year (via semesters table)
```
