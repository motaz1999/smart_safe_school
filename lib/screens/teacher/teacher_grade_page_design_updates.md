```

3. Search/filter box to find students by name or ID
4. Sort options for the student list
5. Improved spacing and visual hierarchy

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Dashboard Widget

2. Update TeacherDashboard widget to include current academic period widget
3. Add error handling for cases with no current academic period

### Step 2: Update Grade Entry Screen
1. Modify _buildGradesList method in TeacherGradesScreen
2. Add student ID/roll number to student display
3. Improve layout of grade and notes fields
4. Add visual indicators for existing grades
5. Implement search/filter functionality
6. Add sorting options

### Step 3: Update Related Components
1. Update any related UI components to maintain consistency
2. Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes
3. Update documentation to reflect changes

## File Changes

### New Files
- None

### Updated Files
1. `lib/screens/teacher/teacher_dashboard.dart` - Add current academic period widget
2. `lib/screens/teacher/grades_screen.dart` - Update student grade display
3. `lib/services/teacher_service.dart` - Add method to get current academic period

## Service Method Updates

### New Method
```dart
/// Gets the current academic year and semester for the teacher's school
Future<AcademicPeriod?> getCurrentAcademicPeriod() async {
  // Implementation to get current academic year and semester
}
```

### Updated Method
```dart
/// Gets the current semester for the current school
Future<Semester?> getCurrentSemester() async {
  // May need updates to work with new academic year structure
}
```

## Testing Considerations

### Dashboard Widget
- Test with current academic year/semester set
- Test with no current academic year/semester
- Test refresh functionality
- Test error handling

### Grade Entry Screen
- Test with classes of various sizes
- Test search/filter functionality
- Test sorting options
- Test visual indicators for existing grades
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Benefits of Updates
1. **Improved Context**: Teachers can easily see current academic period on dashboard
2. **Enhanced Usability**: Better grade entry interface with search, filter, and sorting
3. **Visual Clarity**: Clear indicators for students with existing grades
4. **Efficiency**: Easier navigation and data entry for large classes

## Integration with Existing Design
These updates will integrate with the previously designed academic year/semester selection flow:
1. The dashboard widget complements the selection flow by showing current period
2. The updated grade entry screen improves the final step of the flow
3. Both updates maintain consistency with the overall design approach
