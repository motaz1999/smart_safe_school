# Timetable Screen Modification Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the modifications needed to add navigation from the timetable screen to the attendance marking screen for teachers.

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current timetable screen displays a grid-based view of classes scheduled for the week. For teachers, each timetable entry shows:
- Subject name
- Class name
- Time range

The screen already differentiates between student and teacher views, which is important for our implementation.

## Modification Requirements

1. Add tap functionality to timetable entries for teachers
2. When a teacher taps on a timetable entry, navigate to the attendance screen
3. Pass necessary data to the attendance screen:
   - classId
   - subjectId
   - teacherId
   - className
   - subjectName
   - date and time information

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modify `_buildTimetableEntryCell` Method

The `_buildTimetableEntryCell` method needs to be updated to make the container tappable for teachers:

```dart
Widget _buildTimetableEntryCell(TimetableEntry entry, {bool isCompact = false}) {
  // For teachers, wrap the container in a GestureDetector or use InkWell
  if (_userRole == 'teacher') {
    return InkWell(
      onTap: () {
        _navigateToAttendanceScreen(entry);
      },
      child: Container(
        // ... existing container implementation
      ),
    );
  } else {
    // For students, keep the existing implementation
    return Container(
      // ... existing container implementation
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. Add Navigation Method

Add a new method `_navigateToAttendanceScreen` that handles the navigation:

```dart
void _navigateToAttendanceScreen(TimetableEntry entry) {
  // Navigate to attendance screen with entry details
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => AttendanceScreen(
        classId: entry.classId,
        subjectId: entry.subjectId,
        teacherId: entry.teacherId,
        className: entry.className ?? 'Unknown Class',
        subjectName: entry.subjectName ?? 'Unknown Subject',
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### 3. Update Imports

Add the necessary import for the attendance screen:

```dart
import '../teacher/attendance_screen.dart';
```

## Data Flow

1. Teacher views their timetable
2. Teacher taps on a timetable entry (subject)
3. App navigates to attendance screen with class and subject information
4. Attendance screen loads student list for the class
5. Teacher marks attendance for students
6. Teacher saves attendance records

## Considerations

1. Only teachers should be able to tap on timetable entries to mark attendance
2. Students should not have this functionality
3. The attendance screen should handle cases where no students are enrolled in a class
4. Error handling for network issues when loading student data
5. Visual feedback when navigating to the attendance screen

## Testing Plan

1. Verify that only teachers can tap on timetable entries
2. Verify that correct data is passed to the attendance screen
3. Verify that navigation works for all timetable entries
4. Verify that the back navigation works correctly
5. Verify that the timetable screen state is preserved after navigation

## Edge Cases

1. Teacher taps on a timetable entry for a class with no students
2. Teacher taps on a timetable entry while data is loading
3. Teacher taps on a timetable entry with network connectivity issues
4. Teacher taps on multiple timetable entries quickly
