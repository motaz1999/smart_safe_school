## Implementation Details Verified

### AdminService Method
The `changeUserPassword` method in AdminService correctly uses the Supabase admin client:

```dart
Future<void> changeUserPassword(String userId, String newPassword) async {
  try {
    print('üîç DEBUG: AdminService.changeUserPassword - Changing password for user: $userId');
    
    // Use admin client to update user password
    await _adminSupabase.auth.admin.updateUserById(
      userId,
      attributes: AdminUserAttributes(
        password: newPassword,
      ),
    ).timeout(
      const Duration(seconds: 30),
      onTimeout: () {
        print('‚ùå DEBUG: Timeout while changing user password');
        throw AdminException('Timeout while changing user password');
      },
    );
    
    print('‚úÖ DEBUG: AdminService.changeUserPassword - Password changed successfully for user: $userId');
  } catch (e) {
    print('‚ùå DEBUG: AdminService.changeUserPassword - Error: $e');
    print('‚ùå DEBUG: AdminService.changeUserPassword - Error type: ${e.runtimeType}');
    throw AdminException('Failed to change user password: $e');
  }
}
```

### UI Integration
Both ManageTeachersScreen and ManageStudentsScreen have been updated with:
1. "Change Password" option in the popup menu
2. Lock icon for visual identification
3. Proper integration with the AdminService method
4. Success and error notifications

### ChangePasswordDialog
A shared dialog component provides:
1. Password input field with validation
2. Password confirmation field with validation
3. Loading state during password change
4. Proper error handling and user feedback

## Conclusion
The admin password change functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. Administrators can now change passwords for both teachers and students through the management interfaces.
