# Admin Password Change Feature

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to change passwords for teachers and students in the Smart Safe School system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. AdminService Extension
A new method `changeUserPassword` was added to the AdminService class:

```dart
Future<void> changeUserPassword(String userId, String newPassword) async
```

This method uses the Supabase admin client to update user passwords:

```dart
await _adminSupabase.auth.admin.updateUserById(
  userId,
  attributes: AdminUserAttributes(
    password: newPassword,
  ),
);
```

### 2. UI Integration

#### Teacher Management
- Added "Change Password" option to the teacher card popup menu
- Implemented `ChangePasswordDialog` for password input
- Added password validation (minimum 6 characters, confirmation match)

#### Student Management
- Added "Change Password" option to the student card popup menu
- Implemented `ChangePasswordDialog` for password input
- Added password validation (minimum 6 characters, confirmation match)

### 3. User Experience
1. Admin navigates to "Manage Teachers" or "Manage Students"
2. Clicks the popup menu (three dots) on a user card
3. Selects "Change Password"
4. Enters and confirms the new password
5. Clicks "Change Password" to apply the change

## Security Considerations
- Only administrators can change passwords for other users
- Passwords must be at least 6 characters long
- Password confirmation ensures no typos
- All operations are logged in the Supabase system

## Error Handling
- Timeout handling for network requests
- User-friendly error messages
- Success notifications
