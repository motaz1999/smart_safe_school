# Default Subjects Data Structure

This document defines the default subjects that will be created for every new school in the system.

## Default Subjects List

The following subjects are considered essential for a basic school curriculum:

1. **Mathematics** - Core subject for logical thinking and problem-solving
2. **English Language** - Primary language of instruction and communication
3. **Science** - Core subject covering fundamental scientific principles
4. **Social Studies** - Study of society, history, and civic education
5. **Geography** - Study of the Earth and its features
6. **Art** - Creative expression and visual arts education
7. **Physical Education** - Physical fitness and sports education
8. **Computer Science** - Introduction to computing and technology

## Subject Details

Each subject will have the following attributes:
- **Name**: Full name of the subject
- **Code**: Short code identifier for the subject
- **Description**: Brief description of the subject content

## Implementation Plan

The default subjects will be created automatically when:
1. An admin first logs into a school that has no subjects
2. Or when an admin manually initializes default subjects through the admin dashboard

This ensures that every school has a basic set of subjects to start with, while still allowing schools to customize their curriculum as needed.
