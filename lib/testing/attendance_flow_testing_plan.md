# Attendance Flow Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing plan for the complete flow from timetable to attendance marking in the Smart Safe School system.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Timetable Navigation
**Objective**: Verify that teachers can navigate from the timetable to the attendance screen.

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a teacher
2. Navigate to the timetable screen
3. Tap on a timetable entry (subject)
4. Verify that the attendance screen opens
5. Verify that correct class and subject information is passed

**Expected Results**:
- Attendance screen opens successfully
- Class and subject information is displayed correctly
- Student list loads for the selected class

### 2. Student List Display
**Objective**: Verify that the student list is displayed correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the attendance screen for a class with students
2. Verify that all students in the class are displayed
3. Verify that student names and IDs are correct
4. Navigate to the attendance screen for a class with no students
5. Verify that appropriate message is displayed

**Expected Results**:
- All students in the class are displayed
- Student information is accurate
- Empty class shows appropriate message

### 3. Attendance Marking
**Objective**: Verify that teachers can mark attendance for students.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the attendance screen
2. Mark several students as present
3. Mark several students as absent
4. Add notes for absent students
5. Verify that UI updates correctly

**Expected Results**:
- Attendance status updates correctly in UI
- Notes field appears for absent students
- UI provides visual feedback for changes

### 4. Attendance Saving
**Objective**: Verify that attendance records are saved correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Mark attendance for several students
2. Click the save button
3. Verify that success message is displayed
4. Navigate away and back to verify records persist
5. Check database directly to verify records exist

**Expected Results**:
- Success message is displayed
- Attendance records persist after navigation
- Database records match UI state

### 5. Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify that errors are handled gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to attendance screen with no internet connection
2. Attempt to save attendance with no internet connection
3. Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
4. Restore internet connection and retry operations

**Expected Results**:
- Appropriate error messages are displayed
- Operations can be retried successfully
- No data loss occurs

### 6. Data Validation
**Objective**: Verify that data validation works correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to save attendance without marking all students
2. Enter invalid data in notes field
3. Verify that validation errors are displayed

**Expected Results**:
- Validation errors are displayed
- Save operation is prevented
- User can correct errors and save successfully

### 7. Edge Cases
**Objective**: Verify that edge cases are handled correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to attendance screen for class with many students
2. Mark attendance for all students quickly
3. Navigate away before saving
4. Verify that appropriate warnings are displayed

**Expected Results**:
- Appropriate warnings are displayed
- Data is not lost unexpectedly
- Performance is acceptable with large classes

## Testing Environments

### Device Types
- Android phone
- Android tablet
- iOS phone
- iOS tablet

### Network Conditions
- High-speed Wi-Fi
- 4G/LTE mobile network
- Slow 3G network
- No network connection

### User Roles
- Teacher with full permissions
- Teacher with limited permissions
- Administrator
- Student (should not have access)

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test attendance marking logic
- Test data validation functions
- Test error handling scenarios
- Test state management

### Integration Tests
- Test complete flow from timetable to attendance saving
- Test database operations
- Test service interactions
- Test UI state changes

### UI Tests

- Test user interactions with attendance controls
- Test visual feedback mechanisms
- Test responsive design

## Manual Testing

### Happy Path
- Complete flow from timetable to attendance saving
- All students marked present
- All students marked absent
- Mix of present and absent students

### Error Path
- Network errors during loading
- Network errors during saving
- Database errors
- Authentication errors

### Edge Cases
- Empty classes
- Very large classes
- Classes with special characters in names
- Students with special characters in names

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Multiple teachers marking attendance simultaneously
- Large classes (50+ students)
- Multiple subjects for same class

### Stress Testing
- Database under heavy load
- Network under heavy load
- Memory constraints

## Security Testing

### Authentication
- Verify only teachers can access attendance screens
- Verify teachers can only access their own classes
- Verify proper session handling

### Data Validation
- Test SQL injection attempts
- Test XSS attempts
- Test buffer overflow attempts

## Reporting

### Test Results
- Document all test cases and results
- Track pass/fail rates
- Identify recurring issues
- Measure performance metrics

### Bug Reporting
- Log all issues found during testing
- Include steps to reproduce
- Include environment information
- Include screenshots where applicable

### Metrics
