# Teacher Grade Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the grade management system in the teacher portal of the Smart Safe School application. The system allows teachers to:

1. View and select academic semesters
2. Enter grades for students in their classes
3. Save grades to the database with proper validation

## Database Schema

The grade management system uses the following database tables:

### Grades Table
- `id`: Unique identifier for each grade record
- `student_id`: References the student who received the grade
- `subject_id`: References the subject for which the grade is given
- `teacher_id`: References the teacher who assigned the grade
- `semester_id`: References the semester when the grade was given
- `grade_number`: Indicates whether this is the first (1) or second (2) grade for the semester
- `grade_value`: The actual grade value (decimal)
- `max_grade`: The maximum possible grade (default 100.00)
- `notes`: Optional notes about the grade

### Semesters Table
- `id`: Unique identifier for each semester
- `academic_year_id`: References the academic year
- `name`: Name of the semester (e.g., "Semester 1")
- `semester_number`: Numeric identifier (1, 2, or 3)
- `start_date`: Start date of the semester
- `end_date`: End date of the semester
- `is_current`: Boolean indicating if this is the current semester

## Implementation Details

### 1. TeacherService Enhancements

New methods were added to the `TeacherService` class to fetch academic years and semesters:

- `getAcademicYears()`: Fetches all academic years for the current school
- `getSemesters()`: Fetches all semesters for the current school
- `getCurrentSemester()`: Fetches the current semester for the current school

### 2. TeacherGradesScreen Component

The `TeacherGradesScreen` component was completely rewritten to provide a better user experience:

#### State Management
- `_semesters`: List of all available semesters
- `_selectedSemester`: Currently selected semester
- `_gradeNumber`: Current grade number (1 or 2)
- `_gradeControllers`: Text controllers for grade input fields
- `_notesControllers`: Text controllers for notes input fields

#### Key Features
- Semester selection dropdown with actual semester data from the database
- Grade number selection (1 or 2)
- Individual text fields for each student's grade and notes
- Proper validation of grade values (0-100)
- Error handling for all operations

#### Data Flow
1. On initialization, the screen loads semesters and student data
2. Teachers can select a semester and grade number
3. Teachers enter grades and notes for each student
4. When saving, the system validates input and saves to the database

### 3. Grade Saving Process

The grade saving process includes:

1. Collection of grade data from UI text fields
2. Validation of grade values (must be between 0 and 100)
3. Creation of Grade objects with updated values
4. Saving to the database using the TeacherService
5. Display of success or error messages

## Validation and Error Handling

### Input Validation
- Grade values must be numeric and between 0 and 100
- Semester selection is required
- Grade number must be either 1 or 2

### Error Handling
- Database errors are caught and displayed to the user
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- User authentication is verified before saving grades

## Testing Considerations

The grade management system should be tested for:

1. Semester selection functionality
2. Grade input validation
3. Data persistence to the database
4. Error handling for various scenarios
5. User interface responsiveness

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the grade management system:

1. Bulk grade import functionality
2. Grade history tracking
3. Grade statistics and reporting
4. Integration with parent notification system
5. Support for different grading scales
