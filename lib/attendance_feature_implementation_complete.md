# Attendance Feature Implementation Complete

## Overview
The attendance marking feature has been successfully implemented in the Smart Safe School system. This feature allows teachers to mark attendance for their classes directly from the timetable screen.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Timetable Screen Integration
- Teachers can now tap on any timetable entry to open the attendance screen
- Students' view remains unchanged
- Navigation passes all necessary information (classId, subjectId, teacherId, etc.)

### 2. Attendance Screen
- Displays class name and subject name
- Shows list of students in the class
- Allows marking students as present or absent
- Provides notes field for absent students
- Save and cancel functionality
- Error handling and validation

### 3. Attendance Service
- Save attendance records to database
- Load existing attendance records
- Update and delete records
- Check if attendance already exists

### 4. Database Integration
- All attendance records are saved to the database
- Records are associated with students, subjects, teachers, and dates
- Existing records are updated rather than duplicated

## How It Works

1. Teacher logs in and navigates to their timetable
2. Teacher taps on a subject in the timetable
3. Attendance screen opens with the class list
4. Teacher marks attendance for each student
5. Teacher saves attendance records
6. Records are stored in the database
