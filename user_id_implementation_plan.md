# User ID Generation Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ Updated database functions created
✅ Migration script created
✅ Documentation created

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Function Updates
- [x] Create updated functions in `updated_user_id_functions.sql`
- [ ] Deploy updated functions to Supabase
- [ ] Test new user creation with updated functions

### 2. Data Migration (Optional)
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Run migration script if needed
- [ ] Verify migrated data

### 3. Application Testing
- [ ] Test admin creation with new ID format
- [ ] Test teacher creation with new ID format
- [ ] Test student creation with new ID format
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality still works

### 4. Documentation
- [x] Create implementation guide
- [x] Create summary document
- [ ] Update any necessary application documentation

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur during deployment:
1. Restore database from backup (if migration was performed)
2. Revert to old ID generation functions
3. Update application code to use old ID format
4. Verify system functionality

## Success Criteria
- New users are created with IDs in format ADM-001-00001, TEA-001-00001, STU-001-00001
- Users from different schools can have the same sequential number without conflicts
- All existing application functionality continues to work
- No data loss during the process
