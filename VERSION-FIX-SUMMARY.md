# 📱 Smart Safe School - Version Display Fix

## ✅ Version Issue Fixed

### 🚨 Problem Identified
When you uploaded the AAB to Google Play Console and downloaded it, the app showed version **1.0.0** instead of the expected version **1.0.4**.

### 🔍 Root Cause
The Android build configuration was using Flutter's automatic version detection (`flutter.versionCode` and `flutter.versionName`), but this wasn't working properly. The Play Store was receiving incorrect version information.

### 🔧 Solution Applied
I've explicitly set the version information in the Android build configuration to ensure the correct version is embedded in the AAB file.

**Before (Automatic):**
```kotlin
versionCode = flutter.versionCode
versionName = flutter.versionName
```

**After (Explicit):**
```kotlin
versionCode = 5
versionName = "1.0.4"
```

## 📱 New AAB File Details

### Version Information
- **Version Name:** 1.0.4 (what users see in Play Store)
- **Version Code:** 5 (internal Play Store identifier)
- **File:** `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- **Size:** 45.3MB
- **Status:** ✅ Ready for Play Store upload

### What This Fixes
- ✅ **Play Store Display:** Will now show version 1.0.4
- ✅ **App Info:** Device settings will show version 1.0.4
- ✅ **Version Consistency:** Matches pubspec.yaml version (1.0.4+5)
- ✅ **Play Console:** Will recognize this as version code 5

## 🔧 Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Android Build Configuration Updated
**File:** `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    applicationId = "com.smartsafeschool.app"
    minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion
    targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion
    versionCode = 5          // ← Explicitly set
    versionName = "1.0.4"    // ← Explicitly set
}
```

### 2. Version Synchronization
- **pubspec.yaml:** `version: 1.0.4+5`
- **Android versionName:** "1.0.4"
- **Android versionCode:** 5
- **All versions now match correctly**

## 🚀 Upload Instructions

### For Play Store Console
1. **Go to** Google Play Console
2. **Navigate to** your app → Production → Create new release
3. **Upload** the new AAB file: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
4. **Version will show as:** 1.0.4 (5)
5. **Users will see:** Version 1.0.4 in Play Store and device settings

### Expected Results
- ✅ Play Store will show version 1.0.4
- ✅ App info in device settings will show 1.0.4
- ✅ No more version 1.0.0 display issue
- ✅ Proper version tracking in Play Console

## 📋 Verification Steps

### After Upload to Play Store:
1. **Check Play Console** - Should show version 1.0.4 (5)
2. **Download from Play Store** - App should show version 1.0.4
3. **Device Settings** - App info should display version 1.0.4
4. **About Screen** - If your app has one, should show 1.0.4

## 🔄 For Future Updates

When you need to update the app version:

### 1. Update pubspec.yaml
```yaml
version: 1.0.5+6  # Next version
```

### 2. Update Android build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
versionCode = 6
versionName = "1.0.5"
```

### 3. Rebuild
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle --release
```
